# Agents Guide

## Scope
- This file applies to the entire repository.

## Core Rules
- Wrap every `className` value with `cn(...)`.
- Do not pass raw Tailwind class strings directly to `className`.
- For conditional or merged classes, use `cn(...)` only (no template-string class composition).
- Keep changes small and consistent with existing patterns in nearby files.

## Project Conventions
- Tech stack: Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Prefer CSS variables and existing design tokens from `src/app/globals.css`.
- Home grid layout is generated by `src/app/lib/layout-engine.ts`; avoid hardcoding column counts in page rendering.

## Verification
- Run `pnpm build` after non-trivial UI/layout changes.
